A dead simple block to animate in "anything" when the block comes into view

== Description ==

This block will just add a wrapper block with an inner group block inside it, which will let you add any content to it. When that block comes into view, it will animate in.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can you add this feature? =

I'm purposely keeping this feature minimum, especially if it means adding bloat to the front end.

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).
